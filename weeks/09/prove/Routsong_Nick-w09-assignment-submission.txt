1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://w09-prove.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/routy/cse-341-node/tree/master/weeks/09/prove

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
N/A

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I'm new to using node, so just about each aspect was pretty cool.

6. In your own words, briefly describe the concept of a callback function and why it is useful.
Callback functions are passed into another function that then executes that callback once the parent function has completed. This ensures that order of execution is respected.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
[5] - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
- Added bootstrap and formatted the form to ensure a professional look.
- Used AJAX to perform the rate calculation with an alert to give the user an instant response.
- Error handling in case the user passes a value outside of the expected criteria.
